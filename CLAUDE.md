# pong — guidance for Claude

This is a Brood (`.blsp`) project scaffolded by `nest new`. Replace this stub
with project-specific guidance — commands, conventions, gotchas.

## Running

- `nest test`   — run the test suite (each test runs in its own green process).
- `nest run`    — invoke the entry point. Defaults to the `main` function in
  the `main` module; override in `project.blsp` with `:main` (bare symbols,
  the manifest is data — `:main app` runs `app/main`; `:main (app start)`
  runs `app/start`; never quote them).
  Each module is a namespace (ADR-065): a file's `defmodule name` makes its
  `def`/`defn` define `name/foo`; a bare reference resolves in the current
  namespace, then through `(:use …)` imports, then root/prelude. So the same
  short name in two modules is fine (`a/parse` vs `b/parse`) — only earmuffed
  `*foo*` vars are ambient/bare and must stay unique.
- `nest run --for 2s` — run a loop / full-screen TUI for a bounded time, then
  exit cleanly (`2s`, `500ms`, or a bare integer of ms). The way to exercise
  a never-returning program end-to-end or in CI.
- `nest format` — format Brood source.

## Writing Brood

`docs/brood-for-claude.md` is the language reference geared for AI assistants
— syntax, idioms, and the patterns that aren't shared with other Lisps. Read
it before generating Brood code. The `.claude/skills/writing-brood` skill
carries the short version and auto-loads when Claude Code edits `.blsp` files.

Brood ships randomness (`rand-int`/`rand-float`/`shuffle`/`sample` — pure and
seedable, thread the seed), bitwise ops (`bit-and`/`bit-or`/`bit-xor`/...),
and discovery (`apropos`, `all-globals`, `doc-search`) — use the last three to
find what exists instead of guessing names.

## MCP integration

`.mcp.json` points Claude Code at this project's `nest mcp` server, so `cd pong && claude`
auto-attaches an agent that can `eval`, `load`, `lookup`, `macroexpand`, `format`,
and discover the image with `apropos` / `all-globals` / `doc-search`, against the
live image (ADR-036, `docs/mcp.md` upstream).
